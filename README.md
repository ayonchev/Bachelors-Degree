# Bachelors degree

Here are all of the projects and solutions that I've created throughout my bachelor's degree. I studied in the *Plovdiv University 'Paisii Hilendarski'*, but I spent one semester studying at *Eötvös Loránd University*, Budapest, because I participated in the **Erasmus+ program**. That's why there is a directory for each of the universities. 

# Courses taken
I've listed the courses that have helped me the most grow as a Software Engineer. Some of them are in this repository and some are in different repositories because of various reasons.

  - In this elective course I was introduced to threads, tasks and parallel programming in *C#*
- [Designing Mobile Applications](https://github.com/ayonchev/Bachelors-Degree/tree/master/University-of-Plovdiv/Designing-Mobile-Applications)
  - In this course I created only the design of a mobile application using *Xamarin.Forms* and in the course specified below I created a fully functioning application 
- [Programming Mobile Applications](https://github.com/ayonchev/Phonebook)

## Eötvös Loránd University

- [Computer Systems](https://github.com/ayonchev/Bachelors-Degree/tree/master/Eotvos-Lorand-University/Computer-Systems)
  - In this course we studied Linux commands, shell scripting in Linux and shell scripting in Windows using *PowerShell*
- [Software Technologies](https://github.com/ayonchev/Bachelors-Degree/tree/master/Eotvos-Lorand-University/Software-Technologies)
  - In this course we had to build a tower defense game. The main purpose was to take us through the whole **Software Development Life Cycle**. We went through requirements gathering, planning, development, testing and we also had to configure a CI pipeline. The game was developed with *WPF* and *C#* and was uploaded to ELTE's GitLab server. The models were created by my teammate.
